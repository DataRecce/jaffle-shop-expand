-- Technique: UNION ALL to combine heterogeneous event sources onto a date spine
-- Joins util_date_spine with multiple event sources using UNION ALL to create an
-- annotated business calendar. Each event type (campaign, contract expiry) is
-- unioned into a common schema, then joined to the date spine so every calendar
-- day shows what business events are active or occurring.
