-- adv_customer_order_pairs.sql
-- Technique: Self-join on consecutive orders using LAG window function
-- Pairs each customer order with their immediately previous order to analyze
-- behavioral changes: time between orders, spending changes, and whether the
-- customer switched stores. This pattern is essential for understanding
-- customer journey progression and retention signals.
