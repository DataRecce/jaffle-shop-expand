-- adv_store_affinity_network.sql
-- Technique: Self-join to build a graph/network of store affinities
-- Finds pairs of stores that share customers by self-joining orders on customer_id.
-- The affinity score is the Jaccard index: shared_customers / union_customers.
-- This creates a network graph where stores are nodes and edges represent
-- customer overlap, useful for cannibalization analysis and cross-promotion.
